 I am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science (ML Concentration) at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. 

I majored in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani, where I pursued various projects and internships in the domains of Deep Learning and NLP, extracting valuable insights from unstructured data sources.

I have about 2.5 years of experience as an SDE at Société Générale in the Investment Banking Division, where I contributed to the development and optimization of tech solutions in a dynamic environment. I am experienced in building responsive web interfaces, robust APIs, and employing Agile methodologies. 

My passion lies in exploring the potential of AI, particularly in the realms of NLP and Reinforcement Learning. I am looking forward to connecting with professionals and engaging in opportunities in AI and software development, aiming to drive technological advancement.
